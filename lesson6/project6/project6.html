	 <p class="desc">Charlie is a very special dog. He was adopted from the shelter. He is now about 10 years old. He is part terrier and part poodle - therefore he is a "terripoo". Charlie attended
	 and passed a 10 week dog obedience class. He has learned "sit", "come here", "drop it", "shake", "down", "take nice" and "stay".

         </figure>
      <p class="desc">Echo is a Corgi and Shepard mix. He was adopted when he was one year old and is turning 12 years old. He loves his dog toys - especially bringing them to you so you can play fetch with him. One of his other favorite games is "find it". He will be told to sit and stay in one room. Next, a dog treat is broken into four parts and hidden in various spots in another room. Then when he hears "find them" he runs into the other room and hunts them down.</p>

He was adopted after being abandoned and left to live on the street. He is three years old and a little larger than Charlie. Jack is very active and very fast. He loves chasing flies. He has even caught a few - told you he was fast.</p>

	    <p>Animals will often do the craziest things. Capturing some of their behaviors to share with others is a treat. </p>
