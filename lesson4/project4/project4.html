    <p>Having a dog can be a very rewarding experience. However, there are a few challenges that any canine owner should be aware.</p>

    <h3>Identification</h3>
    <p>Your dog should wear a collar at all times. Getting an electronic identification chip can be one of the best ways to help you and your dog reconnect if he has gotten lost or run away. The chip is inserted beneath the skin. It takes little time to inset and does not hurt the dog.</p>

    <h3>Visit the Vet</h3>
    <p>Your dog should be checked with a local veterinarian as soon as possible. He should be fully vaccinated. Booster vaccination will be required yearly. It is especially important that your dog is neutered before he comes in contact with other dogs. Neutering will prevent many of the dogs more anti-social habits. If your dog is under six months of age then it is too young to be done.</p>

    <h3>The First Day Home</h3>
    <p>It is best to keep him on a leash. You should show him where his food and water dishes are located. When he is indoors keep him confined with you, You need to take him outdoors at frequent intervals. Take him to the same spot each time and praise him heartily when he goes. Once he learns this new routine he will have to be watched closely.</p>

    <h3>If there is an accident in the house</h3>
    <p>He must get accustomed to his new home and his new routines. However, if there is an accident, then loudly say <span class="imp">"NO!"</span> and take him outside immediately. You must catch the dog in the act if the correction is to be effective. <span class="imp">NEVER</span> hit your dog if an accident occurs. <span class="slant">Praise, not punishment, is the key to a well behaved pet.</span></p>

    <h3>Period of Adjustment</h3>
    <p>The first couple of weeks you and your pet are <span class="slant">"getting to know one another"</span>. He doesn't know why he has come to your home nor what is expected of him. Please be patient with him and anticipate problems before they occur. Don't leave tempting shoes, clothing, or children's toys within reach of your dog. Try to leave the home with as little fanfare as possible. Tearful goodbyes do nothing but add to your dog's anxiety.</p>

      <h3>Things to Watch For</h3>

      <p>When he's first settling in, your dog may experience shyness, anxiety, restlessness, excitement, crying or barking. His appetite may not be good. If any of these symptoms last more than a few days, call your veterinarian.</p>

      <h3>Be Consistent</h3>
      <p>Your new dog must learn a whole set of new rules. Be patient and be consistent. If you want him off the furniture, don't allow him to sit on the couch "sometimes". Don't allow him to do something one time and forbid it another.</p>
