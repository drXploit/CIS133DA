    <h2>T. A. S. K. -- Tim's Animal Services and Kennel</h2> 
    <p>We offer a variety of classes -- both obedience and social. The benefits of taking a class are a happier dog and a happier owner.</p> 
    <h3>Obedience Classes</h3> 
    <p>The Obedience classes we offer include: Puppy Kindergarten, Beginning Obedience, Intermediate Obedience, Advance Obedience and Show. Our Beginning Obedience class covers all the basic commands, including sit, down, stay, come, walking nicely on a leash, and heeling. Also, it includes the elimination of problem behaviors.</p> 
    <h4 class="listing">Obedience Classes Listing</h4> 
    <p>In order to start Puppy Kindergarten your dog should be 12 weeks to 7 months. For Dog Obedience classes the age requirement is 8 months and over.</p> 
    <p id="resp">There are three responsibilities that are expected for attendees to the Obedience classes. First, you must keep your dog on a leash and under control. Second, your dog must be current on vaccinations. And third, you need to practice 15 to 20 minutes each day.</p> 
    <h4>Special Requirements</h4> 
    <h3>Social Classes</h3> 
    <p>The Social Classes we offer include: Free Play, senior play, Visit the Vet and Dog Meets World. Visit the Vet is a free class offered every first and third Saturday morning.</p>
