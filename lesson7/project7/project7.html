<h3 id="DogCat">Dogs - Did you know?</h3>
<p>The smartest dogs are the Border Collie, the Poodle and the Golden Retriever. The dumbest dog is the Afghan.</p>
<p>German Shepherds are known to bite humans more than any other breed. For dogs, the nose knows. They have between 120 million to 300 million scent cells along their nostrils.</p>
<p>A dogs ear is very sensitive, full of sensory nerves that help to preserve hearing. <strong>Never, blow into a dogs ear</strong>, even gently can hurt a dog. It's not the actual act of wind, but the frequency at which you blow. It's like running your fingers on a blackboard, amplified hundreds of times.</p>
<p>Many dogs have a sweet tooth and love chocolate, but it's poisonous for dogs! Have you ever wondered why poodles wear pom-poms on their legs? Originally, the haircut helped the poodle to swim faster and the pom-poms were left on to keep the joints warm. </p>

<h3>Cats  - Did you know?</h3>
<p>There are more than 500 million domestic cats in the world, with 33 different breeds, which is too many to list. More than 35,000 kittens are born in the US alone each year, which is why it's important to spay or neuter your cat (get it fixed so it can't have kittens.) Twenty five percent of cat owners blow dry their cat after a bath. </p>
<p>An adult cat has 32 teeth. They also have 12 whiskers on each cheek in four rows. Whiskers have several purposes including detecting the smallest movements (even wind's direction and temperature,) as well as determining if the cat can fit into a certain space such as a pipe. What some people don't realize (especially those who've ever tugged on one) is that whiskers are not special hairs but actually extensions of the skin. </p>
<p>A cat sees about 6 times better than a human at night, and needs 1/6 the amount of of light that a human does - it has a layer of extra reflecting cells which absorb light. Recent studies have shown that cats can see blue and green. There is disagreement as to whether they can see red. A cat's field of vision is about 200 degrees. Unlike humans, cats do not need to blink their eyes on a regular basis to keep their eyes lubricated. Blue-eyed, pure white cats are frequently deaf.</p>

<p>Cats first became pets in Egypt around 4000 BC but they had to work for their livelihood by getting rid of rodents and unwanted waste. When these beloved pets died, owners shaved off their eyebrows and then mummified their cat so it could be buried with them when they died. The goddess of love and fertility in Egypt was a cat named Bastet. </p>
<p>During the 15th century, cats weren't considered pets and the Pope considered all cat lovers to be witches - and they were burned. Black cats are now considered symbols of luck by Europeans. Over time, several wild species became domestic house cats and today the mixed breeds can be seen at cat shows all over the world. </p>
